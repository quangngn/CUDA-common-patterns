This repo contains implementations of common parallel algorithms such as element-wise add, reduce, matrix transpose, dot product, matrix multiplication ... Each file corresponds to one algorithm, and each has different levels of optimization such as using shared memory, avoiding warp divergence, avoiding bank conflict, ...
